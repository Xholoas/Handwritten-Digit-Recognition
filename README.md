Using CNN and FNN models to make handwritten digit classification.

The aim of this project is to develop and compare the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) for the task of handwritten digit recognition. The project observes the performance of both models using the MNIST dataset.

Algorithms Used : Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN).
Preprocessing Algorithms : Normalization, Grayscale convertion, Noise reduction.
